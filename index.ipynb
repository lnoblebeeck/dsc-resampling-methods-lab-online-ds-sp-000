    "Now that you have some preliminary background on bootstrapping, jackknife, and permutation tests, its time to practice those skills by coding them into functions. You'll then apply these tests to a hypothesis test and compare the results to a parametric t-test.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap sampling works by combining two distinct samples into a universal set and generating random samples from this combined sample space in order to compare these random splits to the two original samples. The idea is to see if the difference between the two **original** samples is statistically significant. If similar differences can be observed through the random generation of samples, then the observed differences are not actually significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function to perform bootstrap sampling. The function should take in two samples A and B. The two samples need not be the same size. From this, create a universal sample by combining A and B. Then, create a resampled universal sample of the same size using random sampling with replacement. Finally, split this randomly generated universal set into two samples which are the same size as the original samples, A and B. The function should return these resampled samples.\n",

The research study is looking to validate whether there is a statistical difference in the blood pressure of these two groups using a 5% significance level.  First, calculate the mean blood pressure of each of the two samples. Then, calculate the difference of these means. From there, use your `combT()` function, defined above, to generate all the possible combinations of the entire sample data into A-B splits of equivalent sizes as the original sets. For each of these combinations, calculate the mean blood pressure of the two groups and record the difference between these sample means. The full collection of the difference in means between these generated samples will serve as the denominator to calculate the p-value associated with the difference between the original sample means.\n",
